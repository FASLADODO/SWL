 *	@subsection UsingCMakeSubsection Using CMake
 *		- Change the directory to SWL-C++.
 *		- Make a build directory.
 *			- e.g.) mkdir my_build_dir
 *		- Change the directory to the build directory.
 *			- e.g.) cd my_build_dir
 *		- Run <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation/">CMake</a>.
 *		- Configure and generate in CMake.
 *		- Run make.
 *			- make
 *			- make test
 *			- make doc
 *
 *	@subsection UsingIDESubsection Using IDE
 *	SWL supports <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>.
 *		- Change the directory to SWL-C++.
 *		- Run IDE.
 *			- Use Code::Blocks in the Unix-like systems.
 *			- Use Visual Studio in Windows.
 *		- Open a file.
 *			- Open build/ *.workspace in Code::Blocks.
 *			- Open build/ *.sln in Visual Studio.
 *		- Build.
 *
 *	@subsection UsingBuildScriptSubsection Using a build script
 *		- Change the directory to SWL-C++.
 *		- Change the directory to build.
 *			- cd build
 *		- Run a build script.
 *			- In the Unix-like systems:
 *				- ./build_all.sh
 *			- In Windows:
 *				- build_all.bat
 *
 *	@section DocumentSection Document
 *	Use the SWL's doxygen configuation file, doc/swl.doxy.
 *		- Change the directory to SWL-C++.
 *		- Change the directory to doc.
 *			- cd doc
 *		- Run <a href="https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/">Doxygen</a> command.
 *			- doxygen swl.doxy
 *		- Open an HTML page or a RTF file.
 *			- Open doc/html/index.html.
 *			- Open doc/rtf/refman.rtf.
